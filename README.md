## üß† Project Overview

This application was designed to meet the requirements of a full-stack technical challenge. The core features include:

- User authentication and registration
- Product browsing and filtering by category
- Detailed product pages with ratings and feedback
- Feedback submission, editing, and deletion (with role-based access)
- Feedback manager for admin users and feedback view for regular users

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for container-based setup)
- PostgreSQL (if running outside Docker)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup (Hybrid: Docker + Local Prisma)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FrigoDev/disruptail-feedback-app
cd disruptail-feedback-app

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Run the app container (Next.js + PostgreSQL)
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Apply DB schema
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# 6. Seed initial users and products
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
npx tsx prisma/seed-products.ts

# 7. Start the development server
npm run dev

```

### üß™ Seeded Demo Data

After running the seed commands, the app is populated with demo users and products:

#### üë§ Users (You can register more)
| Email           | Password | Role  |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| admin@test.com | 123456   | ADMIN |
| user@test.com  | 123456   | USER  |

#### üõçÔ∏è Products
6 diverse products have been seeded, each with an image, description, and assigned category:
- T-Shirt Premium (Clothing)
- Running Sneakers (Footwear)
- Winter Jacket (Clothing)
- Bluetooth Headphones (Electronics)
- Water Bottle (Accessories)
- Desk Lamp (Home & Office)

Each product includes a high-quality embedded base64 image, mock description, and belongs to a clearly distinguishable category for filtering and testing feedback functionality.

## üß© Improvements & Ideas

- Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Protect API routes using middleware (e.g. rate limiting, enhanced session validation)
- Admin dashboard UI with statistics and feedback analytics using sentiment analysis
- Pagination for large product or feedback lists
- Internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support

## üß± Architecture Notes & Modularity Vision

This project was intentionally designed to be **modular**, **scalable**, and easy to maintain. From the beginning, the goal was not just to solve the technical challenge, but to build a clean, production-ready.

### üß© Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns**: Logic is split across routes, UI components, and utility functions to ensure clarity and testability.
- **Reusability**: UI elements and feedback features are abstracted into isolated components.
- **Role-based access**: Admin and user views share code but render conditionally based on authenticated session roles.
- **Progressive enhancement**: Features like feedback filtering, inline editing, and image base64 embedding are layered progressively.
